# DSN RCM Tool Case Study & Project README

## Case Study: Designing a Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Tool for Digital Services Network

### Overview
This case study outlines the design and implementation of a Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) tool for Digital Services Network (DSN), tailored for integration with the DSN Cloud and Dental-Exec platforms. Given DSN’s use of T-SQL (Transact-SQL) in its legacy and cloud systems, a middleware solution, Microsoft SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), was selected to ensure compatibility with Azure Data Factory for the ETL process. The tool provides C-level and senior management with visibility through PowerBI reporting and Microsoft Copilot AI insights, while maintaining data integrity with robust guardrails. This solution aligns with DSN’s cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, enhancing workflow efficiency for dental practices of all sizes.

### Business Challenge
DSN aimed to empower its clients—ranging from single-location practices to multi-site groups—with a comprehensive RCM solution. The challenge was to deliver actionable insights into billing, claims, and referral data while preventing unauthorized data alterations by management. The solution required seamless integration with DSN Cloud features (e.g., implant tracking, e-services) and Dental-Exec capabilities (e.g., EMR, Lexicomp), all within a secure, scalable cloud environment, despite T-SQL compatibility issues with Azure Data Factory.

### Solution Architecture
The RCM tool was designed to align with DSN’s cloud-first strategy, leveraging a .NET platform for API development and Azure services for data management. Key components include:

- **Data Flow and Integration**: Data from the DSN Cloud Database, managed with T-SQL, flows through a middleware layer using SSIS, then into an RCM Data Layer. This is processed via Azure Data Factory’s ETL into an Azure SQL Database, feeding PowerBI dashboards and Microsoft Copilot AI for real-time insights, accessible via a read-only C-Level Dashboard.
- **Security and Compliance**: HIPAA compliance is ensured with AES-256 encryption, continuous Azure backups, and third-party intrusion detection, maintaining data integrity and auditability.
- **Guardrails**: Immutable logs in Azure Blob Storage and Azure AD role-based access control (RBAC) restrict management to view-only access, safeguarding against data edits.

### Implementation Details
1. **DSN Cloud Database**: The central HIPAA-compliant repository, hosting patient records, financials, and inventory data in T-SQL-based systems.
2. **Microsoft SSIS (Middleware)**: Extracts T-SQL data, transforms it (e.g., standardizes billing formats), and passes it to the RCM Data Layer for compatibility with Azure Data Factory.
3. **RCM Data Layer**: Utilizes Azure Data Factory for ETL processes, loading transformed data into Azure SQL Database.
4. **PowerBI Service**: Delivers interactive dashboards for revenue metrics and referral performance, restricted to read-only access for management.
5. **Microsoft Copilot AI**: Analyzes RCM data via secure APIs, providing insights like claim denial predictions integrated into dashboards.
6. **ASP.NET Core API**: Enables CRUD operations for practice staff, integrating with DSN modules (e.g., referral tracking, e-services).
7. **Guardrails and Security**: Immutable logs and RBAC ensure data integrity, with continuous backups and encryption meeting HIPAA standards.

### Results
- **Enhanced Visibility**: C-level and senior management gained real-time insights into revenue cycles, improving strategic decisions.
- **Data Integrity**: Guardrails prevented unauthorized edits, ensuring compliance and audit readiness.
- **Seamless Integration**: The tool integrated effortlessly with DSN Cloud and Dental-Exec, enhancing workflow efficiency for practices despite T-SQL compatibility challenges.

### Next Steps
- **Scalability Testing**: Validate performance under multi-location practice loads with SSIS middleware.
- **User Training**: Roll out training sessions for staff and management on the updated workflow.
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate user feedback for iterative improvements, especially regarding middleware performance.
