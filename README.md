DSN RCM Tool Case Study & Project README
Overview
This case study and project README outline the design and implementation of a Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) tool for Digital Services Network (DSN), tailored for integration with DSN Cloud and Dental-Exec platforms. The tool streamlines billing, claims processing, and analytics for dental practices, leveraging a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and HIPAA compliance. This document compares two implementation approaches: the original Microsoft-based stack using SSIS middleware and Sage Intacct’s AWS-based stack, a leading financial management platform with RCM capabilities. The solution provides C-level and senior management with real-time insights through PowerBI and AI-driven analytics, enhancing workflow efficiency for practices of all sizes.
Business Challenge
DSN aimed to empower clients, from single-location dental practices to multi-site groups, with a comprehensive RCM solution. The challenge was to deliver actionable insights into billing, claims, and referral data while ensuring compatibility with DSN’s T-SQL-based systems and preventing unauthorized data alterations by management. The solution required seamless integration with DSN Cloud (e.g., implant tracking, e-services) and Dental-Exec (e.g., EMR, Lexicomp), within a secure, scalable cloud environment, despite T-SQL compatibility issues with Azure Data Factory.
Objectives

Automate claims processing to reduce errors and accelerate reimbursements.
Provide real-time analytics for actionable financial insights.
Ensure seamless integration with DSN Cloud Database and Dental-Exec for operational efficiency.
Maintain HIPAA-compliant data handling and prevent unauthorized data edits.

Solution Architecture
The RCM tool aligns with DSN’s cloud-first strategy, offering two implementation approaches: the original Microsoft-based stack with SSIS middleware and Sage Intacct’s AWS-based stack tailored for financial management and RCM.
Original Microsoft-Based Architecture

Data Flow: Data from the DSN Cloud Database (T-SQL) flows through Microsoft SSIS middleware to the RCM Data Layer, processed via Azure Data Factory’s ETL into Azure SQL Database, feeding PowerBI dashboards and Microsoft Copilot AI for insights, accessible via a read-only C-Level Dashboard.
Security and Compliance: HIPAA compliance is ensured with AES-256 encryption, Azure backups, and third-party intrusion detection.
Guardrails: Immutable logs in Azure Blob Storage and Azure AD role-based access control (RBAC) restrict management to view-only access.

Sage Intacct AWS-Based Architecture

Data Flow: Data from DSN Cloud and Dental-Exec is integrated via Sage Intacct’s REST APIs and Marketplace connectors, processed within its proprietary AWS-hosted database, and visualized through built-in SaaS Intelligence dashboards and Sage Copilot AI for analytics.
Security and Compliance: Leverages AWS’s HIPAA-compliant infrastructure with AES-256 encryption, role-based access, and 24/7 data center monitoring.
Guardrails: Built-in financial controls and audit trails ensure data integrity, with seamless integration for healthcare-specific workflows.

Workflow Diagrams
Two visualizations illustrate the RCM tool’s architecture: a mermaid diagram for the original Microsoft-based stack and an R-based DiagrammeR diagram for the Sage Intacct stack.
